## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js, Redux, Material UI  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js  
- **Database:** MongoDB

---

## 🛠️ Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IoscEdc/IoSC-Student-Teacher.git
```

Open **two terminals** in separate tabs/windows:

### 1️⃣ Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder and add:

```
MONGO_URL = mongodb://127.0.0.1/school
```

> If you're using MongoDB Atlas, replace with your own connection string.

---

### 2️⃣ Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

- Visit the frontend at: `http://localhost:3000`
- Backend API runs on: `http://localhost:5000`

---

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### ❗ Sign-up / Network Errors

If you see a loading or network error during sign-up:

1. Open `frontend/.env` and **uncomment the first line**.
2. Restart the frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

If it still doesn’t work:

- Open `frontend/src/redux/userRelated/userHandle.js`
- Add this at the top:

```js
const REACT_APP_BASE_URL = "http://localhost:5000";
```

- Replace all `process.env.REACT_APP_BASE_URL` with `REACT_APP_BASE_URL`

> Repeat this for all `*Handle.js` files in folders like `teacherRelated`.

### 🗑️ Delete Function Disabled?

The delete functionality is disabled on the live version. To enable it locally:

1. In `frontend/src/redux/userRelated/userHandle.js`, uncomment the full `deleteUser` function and comment out the one showing the "disabled" message.
2. Go to `frontend/src/pages/admin`, and in every file prefixed with `Show` or `View`, find the `deleteHandler` and:
   - **Uncomment** the `dispatch(deleteUser(...))` line
   - **Comment** out the `setMessage("Sorry...")` line

Example:

```js
// Before
setMessage("Sorry, the delete function has been disabled for now.");
setShowPopup(true);

// After
dispatch(deleteUser(deleteID, address)).then(() => {
  dispatch(getAllSclasses(adminID, "Sclass"));
});
```

Repeat for all relevant files.
